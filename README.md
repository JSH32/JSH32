### Hey I'm Riku ðŸ’¾
I make anything from basic web projects and low level libraries and desktop applications. I make interesting, helpful, sometimes questionable projects and aim to better the world with code. Even though the things I make are fairly insignificant I hope it can be of use to others. I explore new technologies, programming languages, and concepts to better my knowledge and experience.
